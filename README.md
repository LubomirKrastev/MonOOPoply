#### Monopoly is a classic board game where players buy, sell, and trade properties to accumulate wealth and bankrupt their opponents. The game involves strategic decision-making, managing assets, and dealing with various challenges like rent payments, taxes, and chance cards. Players aim to dominate the board by owning valuable properties and building houses and hotels while avoiding bankruptcy.
